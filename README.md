# tawk.to iOS Practical Test

## General

1. ~~In the first screen, the app has to fetch GitHub users list, parse it and display in the list (using UITableView or UICollectionView).~~
2. ~~Selecting a user has to fetch the user's profile data and open a profile view displaying the user's profile data.~~
3. ~~The design must loosely follow the wireframe (at the bottom of this document).~~
4. ~~Own code logic should be commented on.~~

## Generic Requirements

1. Code must be done in Swift 5.1. using Xcode 12.x, target iOS13.
2. ~~Core Data​ must be used for data persisting.~~
3. ~~UI must be done with ​UIKit ​using ​AutoLayout.~~
4. ~~All ​network calls​ must be ​queued​ and l​imited ​to ​1 ​request at a time.~~
5. ~~All ​media ​has to be ​cached​ on disk.~~
6. ~~For GitHub api requests, for image loading & caching and for CoreData integration only Apple's apis are allowed (no 3rd party libraries).~~
7. ~~Use Codable to inflate models fetched from api.~~
8. Write Unit tests using ​XCTest ​library for data processing logic & models, CoreData
models (validate creation & update).

## GitHub Users

1. ~~The app has to be able to work ​offline ​if data has been previously loaded.~~
2. ~~The app must handle ​no internet ​scenario, show appropriate UI indicators.~~
3. The app must ​automatically​ retry loading data once the connection is available.
4. ~~When there is data available (saved in the database) from previous launches, that
data should be displayed first, then (in parallel) new data should be fetched from the backend.~~

## Users list

1. ~~Github users list can be obtained from ​https://api.github.com/users?since=0​in JSON format.~~
2. ~~The list must support pagination (​scroll to load more​) utilizing ​since p​arameter as the integer ID of the last User loaded.~~
3. ~~Page size​ has to be dynamically determined after the first batch is loaded.~~
4. ~~The list has to display a spinner while loading data as the last list item.~~
5. ~~Every fourth avatar's colour should have its colours inverted.~~
6. ~~List item view should have a note icon if there is note information saved for the given user.~~
7. ~~Users list has to be searchable - local search only; in ​search mode,​ there is no
pagination; username and note (see Profile section) fields should be used when
searching; precise match as well as ​contains s​ hould be used.~~
8. List (table/collection view) must be implemented using at least ​3 different cells
(normal, note & inverted) and ​Protocols

## Profile

1. ~~Profile info can be obtained from ​`https://api.github.com/users/[​username]​` in JSON format~~​
2. ~~The view should have the user's avatar as a header view followed by information fields (UIX is up to you)~~
3. ~~The section must have the possibility to retrieve and save back to the database the Note​data (not available in GitHub api; local database only).~~

## Submit your work

1. ~~Make sure code is running on both - simulator and real device.~~
2. ~~Push up to your repo. The repository should be publicly accessible - must not require
any invitation to be accepted or registrations.~~
3. Reply back to the initial email the link to your repository.
4. ~~Any 3rd party code that is being used has to be bundled with the code even if the
project is using any code dependency manager.~~
5. ~~Please indicate which bonus tasks (see next section) have you completed.~~

## Bonus Features

1. Empty views such as list items (while data is still loading) should have Loading Shimmer aka ​Skeletons ​~ https://miro.medium.com/max/4000/0*s7uxK77a0FY43NLe.png​r​esembling​final views.​
2. ~~Exponential backoff ​must be used​​when trying to reload the data.~~
3. Any data fetch should utilize ​Result types.​
4. CoreData stack implementation must use t​wo managed contexts​- 1.​main context​to
be used for reading data and feeding into UI 2. write (​background) context​- that is
used for writing data.
5. All CoreData ​write ​queries must be ​queued​ while allowing one concurrent query at
any time.
6. ~~Coordinator and/or MVVM patterns are used.~~
7. ~~Users list UI must be done in code and Profile - with Interface Builder.~~
8. ~~Items in users list are greyed out a bit for seen profiles (seen status being saved to
db).~~
9. The app has to support ​dark mode.​

## Additional Features

1. ~~Tappable blog url from user profile.~~
2. ~~Offline indicator. Github users title will turn to orange when offline or no internet connection.~~
